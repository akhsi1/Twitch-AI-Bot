In Throne and Liberty, developed by NCSoft, players can choose from distinct weapon types, each offering unique abilities and playstyles. These weapons are categorized into two tiers: Tier 1 (T1) and Tier 2 (T2). Mastering these weapons unlocks specialized skills and passive bonuses, enhancing combat effectiveness.

Talandre Update (March 6, 2025):

Talandre is a new highland region in TL, featuring six distinct fields such as Quietis’s Demense, Swamp of Silence, and Black Anvil Forge. Players will encounter four field bosses, including Daigon, Leviathan, Manticus, and Pakilo Naru, as well as two Archbosses, Deluzhnoa and Giant Cordy. Three new field dungeons – Temple of Truth, Bercant Mansion, and Crimson Mansion – are also available, offering players the opportunity to acquire new T2 weapons and equipment.
Alongside the introduction of Talandre, NCSOFT has raised the maximum character level to 55. The update also features four new Adventure Codex, expanding the story of TL, and a new 3-star co-op dungeon ‘Forest of Grudge’, where players can obtain T2 accessory items. NCSOFT plans to roll out four additional 3-star co-op dungeons on a bi-weekly basis.
In the new mastery update, players' masteries will be transferred over. If the mastery level is 20 in T1, they will be transferred to level 80 in T2.

# Archboss summary
Types of Bosses: Throne and Liberty has three boss types: Guild Bosses, Field Bosses, and Archbosses. Archbosses drop powerful weapons.

Timetable and Boss Spawn Info:

Check Archboss spawn times via the in-game Timetable (Hourly/Daily options).
A Schedule icon near the Minimap shows bosses spawning in the next hour.
Zone Mechanics:

In Peace zones, players enter Dimensional Passages that close 5 minutes after the hour.
In Conflict zones, PvP is active during the fight, and the boss spawns 5 minutes after the hour. Players' damage/healing output affects rewards.
Roaming Archbosses: Both bosses roam their zones, dropping rare items (e.g., Bellandir’s Carapace, Tevent’s Soul Fragment) for crafting weapons over time.

Queen Bellandir Fight:

# Weapon Summaries:

Greatsword: Specializes in single-target lockdown with heavy bursts and crowd control (CC). It excels in Wrath attacks to disrupt tanks but relies on CC for damage. Great for skirmishes but less effective in large-scale PvE.

Sword & Shield (SNS): A tank-focused weapon with strong defensive abilities, active/passive block, and crowd control. It supports high defense and offensive potential, with popular combinations being SNS with Greatsword, Dagger, or Wand for varied playstyles.

Dagger: A versatile weapon effective with any combination, but weak as a main DPS. It has high evasion, crit potential, and access to stealth, making it useful in burst damage and evasion builds. Best paired with other weapons for synergistic damage.

Bow: Delivers strong ranged damage, suited for both PvE and PvP. It offers crowd control, stealth detection, and powerful burst potential. Paired with Dagger or Staff, it excels in large-scale content.

Crossbow: Plays like a close-range weapon with high crit damage, mobility, and multi-hit scaling. It is a challenging weapon that pairs well with the Dagger for poison stacking and stealth gameplay.

Staff: A ranged AoE magic weapon, focused on burn damage and heavy attacks. Best in large-scale PvP, and pairs well with Dagger for crit/stealth or Wand for hybrid healer-DPS builds.

Wand: Offers two roles: healer or damage dealer. As a healer, it provides group healing and buffs. As a DPS, it focuses on curse-based AoE damage. Best paired with Dagger for curse bombs or Staff for support builds.

# T2 Weapon Mastery System:
The Weapon Mastery system enables players to allocate passive bonuses toward different aspects of combat, such as damage output, recovery, or mobility. Each weapon has its own mastery tree with three branches, allowing for specialization in various playstyles.

A maximum of 200 points can be spent on the Mastery tree, with each node requiring 10 points.
Players can only have two masteries, with significant effects based on weapon choice.
Mastery paths include attack, tactics, defense, and support, each offering different benefits.

T2 Mastery System Details:
Masteries can improve one stat while decreasing another, adding complexity to builds.
Daily contracts and Co-op dungeons help gain Mastery XP.
Contracts will provide weapon Mastery seals for assigning XP to specific weapons.
Focus on the two highest-level weapons for the best results.
Players can transfer Mastery levels between weapons. Mastery conversion books will be available for purchase or obtained through events.
The system is designed for long-term progression, Mastery soft cap is around 130 to 150 points, with 200 points being the hard cap
Grinding is required to level up the Mastery system, making it a long-term investment.

# Does primary (mainhand) or secondary (offhand) weapon matter in Throne and Liberty?
Auto-attacks and Weapon Stats:

Auto-attacks depend on the mainhand (primary) weapon. For example, with a bow in the mainhand, players can attack from range, while a dagger in the mainhand enables close-quarters fast attacks.
The mainhand weapon’s stats (e.g., attack speed, range, and special bonuses like damage reduction) apply to players' character. Offhand weapons provide fewer or no stats for basic attacks and passives.
Skills and Weapon Swap:

When using a skill, the game automatically pulls out the relevant weapon, meaning the position of the weapon (mainhand or offhand) doesn't impact skills. However, the weapon used for the skill determines the damage and passives applied during its use.
Epic passives (especially from enhanced or rare weapons) may not work effectively in the offhand, making it crucial to equip user's main damage-dealing weapon in the primary slot for full benefits.
Weapon Mastery and Passives:

Mastery passives (defensive bonuses, evasion, attack speed) are linked to the primary weapon. Some players report that offhand passives may not apply as effectively, making weapon order important for optimizing passive benefits like evasion (from daggers) or defense (from shields).
Weapon-specific passives (from skills) only activate when the weapon is used, but general item stats (like HP or overall damage bonuses) apply regardless of weapon equipped.
Min-Maxing and PvP Considerations:

For min-maxing, players often swap weapons during combat, depending on the situation, using dedicated buttons to optimize between offense and defense.
In PvP, the choice of mainhand weapon is crucial for determining auto-attacks and applying key passives like evasion or extra HP. Players often prioritize defensive masteries in their mainhand, while offhand weapons might be used for skill-specific benefits.
Upgrading and Skill Damage:

Enhancing offhand weapons (even if they are not in the primary slot) can significantly increase skill damage if that skill utilizes the offhand weapon. Prioritizing upgrades for both weapons is recommended to maximize damage output, especially when skills rely on the secondary weapon.
In conclusion, the mainhand weapon determines players' auto-attacks, key passives, and primary stats, while skills pull out the appropriate weapon when needed. Offhand weapons impact certain skills but provide fewer bonuses for basic combat. Optimizing the user's primary weapon is important, especially for stat-based passives and damage output.

Whelps has a video on which weapon to use as mainhand or offhand, titled "Mastery Explained & Which Weapon You Should Hold": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyLmxBRtsGo

# General Information
Max range stat determines the maximum range a ranged weapon such as staff or bow can reach, Max range is 30m and it does not go beyond 30m even if the tooltip in-game says so.
xbow refers to crossbow, longbow refers to bow - They are different weapons.
Whelps is playing spear/dagger in tier 2 global version of tnl, and bow/staff in kr version of tnl.
Whelps posts his builds on a website called Questlog (questlog.gg). If a user asks about questlog or build, offer them the !build command.
Sollant and Lucent are currencies in Throne and Liberty.
GvG = Guild vs Guild
ZvZ = Zerg vs Zerg (Large scale)
As a gs/dagger or spear/dagger user, prioritize tevent dagger.
As a bow/staff user, prioritize queen bellandir staff over tevent bow.
Endurance and Evasion are defensive stats people commonly have a hard time deciding on which one is better suited for survivability. It's bad to have a mix of both, it's better to build only evasion or only endurance.
Generally, pick evasion if using a dagger, otherwise Endurance.
Crit counters Endurance builds whilst Hit chance (hit) counters evasion builds.
Evasion and Endurance has 3 types: Ranged Evasion/Endurance, Magic Evasion/Endurance, and Melee Evasion/Endurance, all 3 Evasion or Endurance types are equal in survivability and depends on the user's preference.
