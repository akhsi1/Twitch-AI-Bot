2025-02-13T14:34:16.793Z - @thewhelps i was wondering isnt mele evasion on t2 kinda bad ?because of possibily of greatsword which could go for 3k hit chance ?-140
Hey @denyx24! For T2, if you're using a greatsword and aiming for high hit chance , melee evasion might not be ideal due to the trade-off with hit chance. It's better suited for builds focusing on evasion rather than hit chance.

2025-02-13T14:35:58.280Z - @thewhelps which 2 evasion do you recommend for t2? magic, ranged, melee?-140
Hey @josemyak! In general, if you're using a dagger, go for evasion; otherwise, endurance works well. For specific builds like bow/staff , endurance is recommended.

2025-02-13T14:41:21.128Z - where is staff/wand build???, please talk more about it-140
Hi Spectrerina! You can check out Whelps' builds, including the Staff/Wand combination, using the `!build` command in chat: https://www.youtube.com/@Whelps

2025-02-13T14:44:03.477Z - your evasion hit build for spear/dag has 2.4k hit with sentinel buff on, will that be enough in t2 though?-140
For a Spear/Dagger build, aim for 3500 Hit Chance with Greatsword/Spear builds. Your current 2400 might be low in T2. Consider increasing it to meet this target.

2025-02-13T14:53:54.182Z - whats the build ?-140

2025-02-13T14:59:42.473Z - @thewhelps  would you prefer your gs speer  endurance or evasion build ?-140
Hi @jump1904! For a GS/Spear build, generally choose endurance unless you're using a dagger, in which case evasion is better.

2025-02-13T15:01:14.611Z - you think liberator in t2 with new masterys is not that good as spellblade? if yes full endurance or evasion what do you recommend?-140
Hi @kewzytv! For T2, Whelps recommends using endurance for Liberator  builds. If you're considering Spellblade , evasion is generally better with daggers. Check out Whelps' tierlist for more details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAd03smE8ok
